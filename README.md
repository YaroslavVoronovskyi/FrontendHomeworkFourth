Task 1: Event Handling

Write a simple HTML page with a button. Using JavaScript, create an event handler that triggers an alert when the button is clicked. Additionally, implement another event handler that changes the background color of the page when the mouse is over the button. Explain the concept of event propagation and how it is relevant to these event handlers.

Task 2: Keyboard Events

Create an HTML form with a text input field. Write JavaScript code to capture the "keydown" event on the input field and log the key code of the pressed key to the console. Extend the functionality by preventing the default action for the "Enter" key and instead, display an alert with the content of the input field. Explain how you would handle other keyboard events like "keyup" and "keypress" in a similar scenario.

Task 3: Event Delegation

Construct an unordered list (UL) with multiple list items (LI) dynamically using JavaScript. Implement event delegation by attaching a single click event listener to the UL, and then dynamically handle the click event based on the clicked LI. Discuss the advantages of using event delegation in terms of performance and code maintainability.

Task 4: Custom Events

Create a webpage that simulates a simple online shopping cart. Implement custom events for adding items to the cart and updating the total price. When an item is added, dispatch a custom "itemAdded" event, and when the total price is updated, dispatch a "priceUpdated" event. Write JavaScript code to listen for these custom events and update the UI accordingly. Explain the benefits of using custom events in this scenario.
